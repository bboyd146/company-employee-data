## Description
This project is a Company Management System built with MySQL as the database foundation.

The database models key aspects of a company, including:

Employees (with roles, managers, payroll, and projects)

Departments and their locations

Projects and employee assignments

Payroll and compensation tracking

The schema enforces referential integrity with foreign keys, cascading rules, and self-references for hierarchical relationships (e.g., employees managed by other employees).

ðŸ”® Future Development

This is the backend foundation for a full-stack application.
In the next phases, we plan to add a front-end user interface that will allow:

HR staff to add and manage employees, roles, and departments

Project managers to assign employees to projects and track budgets

Employees to view their details and project assignments

Automated payroll tracking and reporting

The front end will be built with React and will interact with this MySQL database through a Node.js/Express API.

Ultimately, the goal is to provide a realistic company management system that simulates how modern businesses organize employees, projects, and finances.
